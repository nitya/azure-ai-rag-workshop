??? info "Scenario: Customer Support Chat for Online Retailer - _click to expand_"
    
    We are building a customer support AI (copilot) for an online retailer, where customer questions receive responses grounded in the retailer's data.

    - **Contoso Outdoors** is a retail enterprise that sells camping and hiking equipment.
    - **Contoso Web (UI)** is the website frontend providing the customer UI/UX.
    - **Contoso Chat (AI)** is the AI backend processing customer questions & returning relevant responses.

## 4. Data

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern allows us to _customize the AI_ by enhancing the user prompt with _dynamically retrieved knowledge_ that grounds the responses in the provided context.
Let's understand the shape of the data available to us.

### 4.1 Customer Info

This record represents _a single customer_, providing their profile information ("id", name, contact info) and their purchase history ("orders"). _This JSON data may be stored in a noSQL datbase like Azure CosmosDB and retrieved dynamically by the chat AI_.
