# 1.3 Azure AI Template

!!! note "The Azure AI Foundry [Code Preview](https://ai.azure.com/build/code) tab in an active Azue AI project will list 3 azd-capable templates, one of which is the [Get started with Azure AI](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azureai-basic-python) basic starter template. We'll use this as our reference in this tutorial."

## 1. Before We Begin

Let's look at what our default folder structure looks like. You should see the following. Make note of this so we can identify the new folders/files that get added when we "azd init" the repo.

```bash title=""
.devcontainer/   # Launch pre-build dev environment in GitHub Codespaces
.github/         # Add workflows for automated CI/CD actions
data/            # Contains data for AI application needs
docs/            # Contains documentation for AI application workshop
src.sample/      # Contains app code (working sample)
env.sample/      # Contains env variables (placeholder sample)
.gitignore       # Contains .gitignore rules
LICENSE          
mkdocs.yml       # Configuration for mkdocs documentation site
README.md        # README for repo
REFERENCES.md    # REFERENCES for repo
requirements.txt # Python dependencies for application

```
