# 1.3 Azure AI Template

!!! note "The Azure AI Foundry [Code Preview](https://ai.azure.com/build/code) tab in an active Azue AI project will list 3 azd-capable templates, one of which is the [Get started with Azure AI](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azureai-basic-python) basic starter template. We'll use this as our reference in this tutorial."

## 1. Before We Begin

Let's look at what our default folder structure looks like. You should see the following. Make note of this so we can identify the new folders/files that get added when we "azd init" the repo.

```bash title="" linenums="0"
.devcontainer/   # Launch pre-build dev environment in GitHub Codespaces
.github/         # Add workflows for automated CI/CD actions
data/            # Contains data for AI application needs
docs/            # Contains documentation for AI application workshop
src.sample/      # Contains app code (working sample)
env.sample/      # Contains env variables (placeholder sample)
.gitignore       # Contains .gitignore rules
LICENSE          
mkdocs.yml       # Configuration for mkdocs documentation site
README.md        # README for repo
REFERENCES.md    # REFERENCES for repo
requirements.txt # Python dependencies for application

```

## 2. View AI Template

Let's take a look at what the folder structure for the [Get started with Azure AI](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azureai-basic-python) basic starter template looks like by visiting that repo:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
.azdo/pipelines/        # Azure DevOps pipelines 
.devcontainer/          # Dev Container configuration
.github/                # GitHub Actions workflows
docs/                   # README assets and docs
infra/                  # Infrastructure-as-code assets
scripts/                # Scripts for azd hooks 
src/                    # Application source
.gitignore
.pre-commit-config.yaml # Pre-commit hooks: code quality checks
LICENSE
README.md
azure.yaml               # Azure Developer CLI configuration
pyproject.toml           # Python Project configuration
requirements-dev.txt     # Python Project package dependencies
```

## 3. Initialize Template

To use that template, we need to run the right azd command in our repo.

!!! info "**Note**: In this case we are retrofitting an existing sample using the azd template." 

    This means we have to reconcile conflicts in files like `.devcontainer.json` which get overwritten by the `azd init` process when using an existing template. This leads to the roundabout process described below. Instead you can also start with an empty repository and initialize the template first - then refactor the contents step by step to reflect your application needs. We can explore that approach later.


### 3.1 Create Sandbox 
 Let's see what happens when we run this at the root of our existing folder:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
azd init -t azureai-basic-python
```

You should see a warning like this:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
Initializing an app to run on Azure (azd init)

WARNING: The current directory is not empty.
Initializing an app in this directory may overwrite existing files.

? Continue initializing an app in '/workspaces/azure-ai-rag-workshop'? (y/N) 
```

We don't want this to happen since we are using the `.devcontaine/`, `.github/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` and `docs/` filenames for our own content. Instead, let's see what happens when we run this in a _sandbox_ directory. We can then compare the contents and move them into the root folder in a more informed manner.

```bash title="" linenums="0"
mkdir SANDBOX
```
```bash title="" linenums="0"
cd SANDBOX/
```

### 3.2 Run `azd init`

```bash title="" linenums="0"
azd init -t azureai-basic-python
```

You now see something like this:

```bash title="" linenums="0"

Initializing an app to run on Azure (azd init)
  (âœ“) Done: Downloading template code to: /workspaces/azure-ai-rag-workshop/SANDBOX

? Enter a new environment name: [? for help] 
```

At this point, if you view the `SANDBOX/` folder in the explorer sidebar on VS Code, you will see the file structure from [the template view](#2-view-ai-template) replicated here, along with an empty `.azure/` folder.

### 3.3 Complete init

Let's continue with the `azd init` wizard workflow by providing an environment name. Let's pick _ragchat-aip_ as a symbolic name for the RAG Chat app on the Azure AI Platform. You should now see this:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
? Enter a new environment name: ragchat-aip

SUCCESS: New project initialized!        
You can view the template code in your directory: /workspaces/azure-ai-rag-workshop/SANDBOX
Learn more about running 3rd party code on our DevHub: https://aka.ms/azd-third-party-code-notice
```

If you look in the `SANDBOX/` folder you will now see the `.azure/` folder is updated:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
.azure/
    ragchat-aip/
        .env             # has: AZURE_ENV_NAME="ragchat-aip"
        config.json      # is empty
    .gitignore
    config.json          # has: {"version":1,"defaultEnvironment":"ragchat-aip"}
```

### 3.4 Merge Sandbox

We can now merge the contents from `SANDBOX/` into the root of the folder in a way that preserves pre-existing files:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
cd SANDBOX/
mv .azdo .azure ../.
mv README.md ../README.azd.md
mv docs/* ../.
mv infra scripts src .pre-commit-config.yaml azure.yaml pyproject.toml requirements-dev.txt .gitignire ../.
mv .github/* ../.github/
mv .github/workflows/* ../.github/workflows
```

Now we need to make a few fixes:

- Update the `README.azd.md` to point to the right location (root) for the two files that were in the docs/ directory but are now at root level - so they resolve correctly.

- Add these two lines to the end of `.gitignore` 
  ```bash title="" linenums="0"
  # From RAG Chat
  site/
  .DS_Store
  ```

All that is left is the `.devcontainer.json` reconciliation. For convenience, just copy these files into the relevant files in `.devcontainer/`

!!! task "3. We can now delete the `SANDBOX/` folder."


## 4. Validate Template

Let's see if our merged repository is now an active azd template before we dive into the details and start modifying it!

### 4.1 Authenticate 

First authenticate with Azure - use the `--use-device-code` flag if running in GitHub Codespaces.

```bash title="" linenums="0"
azd auth login --use-device-code
```

Complete the workflow as instructed - you should see this on success:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
Waiting for you to complete authentication in the browser...
Device code authentication completed.
```

### 4.2 Provision and Deploy 

Provision and deploy template using the command below. You will be asked to select the subscription and location for deployment. It should then update the `.azure/.env` file with the relevant parameters, then create a resource group called `rg-ragchat-aip` in which it will provision the resources and deploy the app.

```bash title="" linenums="0"
azd up
```

??? warning "TROUBLESHOOTING: Insufficient Quota (expand to view)"

    - You may get an `InsufficientQuota` error if you pick the wrong location. One way to avoid this is to check [Quota](https://ai.azure.com/quota) and pick a location with available quota.

    - To fix the issue: the simplest option is to 
        - `azd down --purge` (to release all resources created), 
        - then update the `.env` file (to select location with quota). _Takes time_.
        - then `azd up` again to complete successful deploy. _Takes time_.

!!! success "You should see something like this for a successful deployment:"

```bash title="" linenums="0"
azd auth login --use-device-code

```

!!! tip "**FAQ:** How do resources get a consistent identifier like `26dkr7mmmco62`?"

    This is one of the useful outcomes from our azd template configuration. The `main.bicep` file defines a _resourceToken_ variable as shown below, that is then used as a suffix in naming every resource within that group. 

    ```bicep title="infra/main.bicep"
    var resourceToken = toLower(uniqueString(subscription().id, environmentName, location))
    ```

    The variable is created from a unique hash of the subscription, environment name and location strings for that deployment, reducing the possibility of naming conflicts but also making it easier for us to retrieve resources using a deterministic identifier (defined by resourceToken) later.
     

### 4.3 Environment Vars

You should now be able to view the `.azure/<env-name>/.env` file and see the environment variables defined with values:

```bash title="" linenums="0"

AZURE_AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="eastus.api.azureml.ms;XXXXXXXXXXX;rg-nitya-ragchat-azd;ai-project-26dkr7mmmco62"
AZURE_AI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
AZURE_CONTAINER_ENVIRONMENT_NAME="containerapps-env-26dkr7mmmco62"
AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT="cr26dkr7mmmco62.azurecr.io"
AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME="cr26dkr7mmmco62"
AZURE_ENV_NAME="nitya-ragchat-azd"
AZURE_LOCATION="eastus"
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-nitya-ragchat-azd"
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="XXXXXXXXXXX"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXXXXX"
SERVICE_API_ENDPOINTS="[\"https://ca-api-26dkr7mmmco62.XXXXXXXXXXX.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io\"]"
SERVICE_API_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID="XXXXXXXXXXX"
SERVICE_API_IMAGE_NAME="cr26dkr7mmmco62.azurecr.io/azd-aistudio-starter/api-nitya-ragchat-azd:azd-deploy-1740393080"
SERVICE_API_NAME="ca-api-26dkr7mmmco62"
SERVICE_API_RESOURCE_EXISTS="false"
SERVICE_API_URI="https://ca-api-26dkr7mmmco62.XXXXXXXXXXX.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io"
```

### 4.4 Local Dev Server

You should now be able to run the local server using the deployed model endpoint as follows:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
cd src/
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn "api.main:create_app" --factory --reload
```

You should see output like this:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
@nitya âžœ /workspaces/azure-ai-rag-workshop/src (azdify) $ python -m uvicorn "api.main:create_app" --factory --reload
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/workspaces/azure-ai-rag-workshop/src']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [11197] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [11199]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### 4.5 Local Chat UI 

Open the browser to the local dev server URL identified above. You will see a chat UI as shown.

![Chat UI](./../img/azd-deploy-localserver.png)

Ask questions (at the bottom) and get responses from the default model provisioned (gpt-4o-mini). **Note: This default app does not do anything else - it is not grounded in data but is instrumented for analytics with App Insights**.

!!! success "Your local development environment has been validated!"

### 4.6 Azure Portal Resources

The `azd up` command first provisions resources in Azure and then deploys the application. Let's take a quick look at what was provisioned by visiting the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and clicking the resource group for this project. _Note: Your resource group will be named `rg-<env>` where the _env_ reflects the envrionment name chosen during deployment (e.g., "nitya-ragchat-azd")

![Azure AI Portal RG](./../img/azure-portal-rg.png)

You should see 11 records that include the following:

1. An **Azure AI hub** resource - _manage billing, org-level admin_
1. An **Azure AI project** resource - _manage state, app-level admin_
1. An **Azure AI services** resource - _manage models, turnkey service integrations_
1. An **Application Insights** resource - _monitor performance (use in tracing)_
1. A **Container App** resource - _hosting chat AI endpoint (FastAPI server)_
1. A **Container Apps Environment** resource - _for container app admin_
1. A **Managed Identity** resource - _for secure keyless authentication_ 
1. A **Key Vault** resource - _for storing secrets_ 
1. A **Log Analytics workspace** resource - _for logging events_ 
1. A **Storage account** resource - _for storing data (blob, file, queue or table)_ 

!!! success "Your azd resource provisioning has been validated!"

### 4.7 Validate Container App

Click on the **Container App** resource.

1. Look for the _Application Uri_ property in the "Essentials" pane.
1. Click it. It should open a blank site in the browser (maps to empty "/" route)
1. Append "/docs" to the website URL and hit enter
1. You should see the Swagger API documentation site as shown below:
    ![Swagger API](./../img/portal-containerapp-swagger.png)
1. Click "Try it Out" and update the _content_ property value to a question.
1. Verify that the _Responses_ panel shows a relevant result (list of messages).

!!! success "Your azd app deployment has been validated!"

### 4.8 Azure AI Foundry Portal 

The Azure Portal is used by IT pros and admins to _manage resources_ for your deployment. As a developer, you will likely spend more time in the _Azure AI Foundry_ portal which helps you **manage your application state** and **debug operations** when required.

1. Visit the [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com) and click **View all projects**
1. Use the **Columns** option to add "Resource Group" as a visible column to the table
1. Look for the Azure AI project corresponding to the `rg-<env>` provisioned - and click.
1. You should see the Project Overview with endpoints and keys information like this. **Note the Project connection string** - we'll reference it later.
    ![Project Overview](./../img/foundry-project-overview.png)
1. Click the **Tracing** tab in the sidebar. _Verify that you see the screen below_. This lets us know the Application Insights resource was successfully deployed for tracing use. To get trace data, we now need to _activate_ tracers in our application code. We'll do that later.
    ![Project Tracing](./../img/foundry-project-tracing.png)
1. Click the **Models + endpoints** option on sidebar. You should see a list like this. _Verify that azd deployed 2 models: chat and embedding_
    ![Project Models](./../img//foundry-models-endpoints.png)
1. Click the _Service endpoints_ tab in this page. You should see the list of turnkey AI Services that you can now take advantage of using the default project connection string.
    ![Project Model Services](./../img/foundry-models-services.png)
1. Click the chat model (gpt-4o-mini) to view the model details page below. You should be able to vew rate limit details and get access to the endpoint and key values if needed. **Note: If you need a higher rate limit** - you can use the `Edit` button to see if your current subscription can support the increase, and update it right here.
    ![Project Model Details](./../img/foundry-model-details.png)
1. Click the "Metrics" tab. to see the usage metrics for the model as shown below.
    ![Project Model Metrics](./../img/foundry-model-metrics.png)

Note that the panel has an **Open in Azure Monitor** link at the top. Let's click that now and talk about App Insights and monitoring.

### 4.9 Validate Monitoring Works

1. This is what you see when you click that link above. You are redirected to the _Azure AI Project_ resource in the Azure Portal, and into the _Metrics_ tab under "Monitoring". Use this panel to explore various metrics on performance (e.g., number of requests, latency etc.) for the Azure OpenAI model.
    ![Metrics](./../img/portal-monitor-metrics.png)
1. You can also click into the _Insights (preview_)_ sidebar option to get this view for Generative AI applications that gives you insights into _token usage_, _request rate_ and _response latency_.
    ![Insights](./../img/azure-portal-insights.png)
1. Once you activate tracing in your application, you should also be able to visit the _Session Details_ tab to see activity traces from that session.
