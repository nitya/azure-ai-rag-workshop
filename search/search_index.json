However, the <code>data/</code> folder provides additional data sources (customer data, product manual data) that can be used for even richer experiences. Think of how you can refactor the existing code to support data retrieval from multiple sources that store this data (e.g., Customer data in Azure Cosmos DB).</p> </li> <li> <p>Write Custom Evaluators - The default evaluators for quality reflect common best practices. However, you may want to assess responses for a custom criteria. Think of how you can write a custom evaluator, and add it into the evalution script. For example: evaluate responses for politeness or for being kid-friendly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explore Richer RAG Patterns - The core of RAG patterns is the retrieval of relevant knowledge from various sources including Azure AI Search. Explore new algorithms or ways of combining context to make the retrieved documents more relevant to application needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make it Agentic - Agentic workflows are dominating the AI ecosystem today.
